  <h2>Our Journey: Spreading Eco-Friendly Ganesha Idols Across Bengaluru</h2>
  <p>
    In 2024, we embarked on a heartfelt mission to bring eco-friendly Ganesha idols into homes and societies across Bengaluru. 
    What started as a small initiative on Instagram and word of mouth quickly grew into a movement, uniting like-minded individuals 
    who wanted to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi while caring for the environment.

  <p>
    With every beautifully crafted clay and biodegradable idol, we not only preserved traditions but also ensured that our beloved 
    Bappa returns to nature without harming our water bodies. From small apartments to large housing societies, our idols found homes, 
    leaving behind smiling faces, satisfied hearts, and an ever-growing eco-conscious Ganesha family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, as we continue this journey, our commitment remains strongâ€”to make every Ganesh Chaturthi a sustainable, joyful, and 
    spiritually fulfilling celebration. ðŸŒ±âœ¨
